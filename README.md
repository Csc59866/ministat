# ministat
A small tool to do the statistics legwork on benchmarks etc.

Written by Poul-Henning Kamp, lured into a dark Linux alley and clubbed over the head and hauled away to Github by yours truly.

## Build & Install

There should be no dependencies besides the standard libraries and a functional tool-chain.

	$ cd ministat/
	$ make
